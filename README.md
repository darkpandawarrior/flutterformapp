Created a Test Form App using Flutter. 
Contains basic detail filling via which you can collect information about the user. 
User data is then stored into a Database using Cloud Firestore.
Note: Since I used a testing Auth Key from Cloud firestore, you'll have to update the Auth with your own key as well as replace some gradle files within to use the Database.
